- **Automatic game data extraction**: The game can automatically extract game data files from provided bin/cue disk image files.

## Setup
To set up your enhanced version of Wipeout, follow the steps below:

- Download the latest release and unzip the `wipeout` folder to your desired location on your hard drive.

- You'll need game data files from the original PlayStation USA-region version of Wipeout. You can either manually provide these files or supply bin/cue disk image files, which can be obtained by ripping a disk you own. The disk image method is preferred as it automatically extracts the music into wav files.

**IMPORTANT:** Ensure that the game data is from the **PlayStation USA-region** version of Wipeout. Data from official PC versions won't work.

### Disk Image Method
- **Place Disk Image Files**: Locate the `wipeout/diskimages` directory and place your Wipeout disk image files there.
- **Ensure Correct Format**: Your disk image must be a multi-bin .bin and .cue format with multiple .bin files (9 are expected) and one .cue file. Each file size can vary between 50mb-60mb.
Example:
  ```
  WipeOut USA (Track 1).bin
  WipeOut USA (Track 2).bin
  WipeOut USA (Track 3).bin
  WipeOut USA (Track 4).bin
  WipeOut USA (Track 5).bin
  WipeOut USA (Track 6).bin
  WipeOut USA (Track 7).bin
  WipeOut USA (Track 8).bin
  WipeOut USA (Track 9).bin
  WipeOut USA.cue
  ```
The game data should be in "MODE2/2352" format in the first track of the cue sheet, while other tracks should be in "AUDIO" format.

**Extraction on Startup**: Upon launching, the game will check for missing data files and attempt to extract them from a disk image.

**Removal of Disk Image Files**: Once the game successfully loads into the main menu, the disk image files are no longer required and can be removed.

**NOTE: Since reading the file system in the disk image is non-trivial, a hash-based search is performed on the data track of the disk image. This can be slow on systems with less than 8 CPU cores.**

### Loose File Method
**Copying Game Files**: If you already possess all the game files (517 in total), copy them directly into the `wipeout/wipeoutgame` folder. These files can be obtained directly from a PlayStation disk using windows explorer.

**Music Files**: The downside of this method is that the music, which is stored in Red Book audio tracks on the CD and not in a file system, cannot be copied.

For music, you can use the Disk Image method, or if you have individual music files, place them in the `wipeout/music` folder. Note that these files must follow a specific naming convention, with 2-digit numbers between 01-32 in their name. For more information, see `wipeout/music/musicgoeshere.txt`.
